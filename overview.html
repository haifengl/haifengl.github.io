    <h1 id="overview-top" class="title">What's Machine Learning</h1>

    <p>Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability
        to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can make
        predictions on data by building a model from example inputs.</p>

    <p>A core objective of machine learning is to generalize from its experience.
        Generalization is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately
        on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a training data set.
        The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution
        and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it
        to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.</p>

    <p>Machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories, depending
        on the nature of the learning &quot;signal&quot; or &quot;feedback&quot; available to a learning system.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Supervised learning</dt>
        <dd><p>The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs,
            given by a &quot;teacher&quot;, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Unsupervised learning</dt>
        <dd><p>No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in
            its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data)
            or a means towards an end (feature learning).</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Reinforcement learning</dt>
        <dd><p>A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal,
            without a teacher explicitly telling it whether it has come close to
            its goal.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

    <p>Between supervised and unsupervised learning is semi-supervised learning, where the teacher gives an
        incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing.</p>

    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

    <p>A feature is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.
        Features are also called explanatory variables, independent variables, predictors, regressors, etc.
        Any attribute could be a feature, but choosing informative, discriminating and
        independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in machine learning.
        Features are usually numeric and a set of numeric features can be conveniently
        described by a feature vector. Structural features such as strings, sequences and
        graphs are also used in areas such as natural language processing, computational biology, etc.</p>

    <p>Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make
        machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine
        learning, and is both difficult and expensive. It requires the experimentation of multiple
        possibilities and the combination of automated
        techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert.</p>

    <p>The initial set of raw features can be redundant and too large to be managed. Therefore,
        a preliminary step in many applications consists of selecting a subset of features,
        or constructing a new and reduced set of features to facilitate learning, and
        to improve generalization and interpretability.</p>

        machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine
        learning, and is both difficult and expensive. It requires the experimentation of multiple
        possibilities and the combination of automated
        techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert.</p>


    <h2 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h2>

    <p>In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a feature vector)
        and a desired output value (also called the response variable or dependent variable).
        Supervised learning algorithms try to learn a function (often called hypothesis) from input object to the output value.
        By analyzing the training data, it produces an inferred function
        (referred as a model), which can be used for mapping new examples.</p>

    <p>Supervised learning problems are often solved by optimizating the loss functions that
        represent the price paid for inaccuracy of predictions. The risk associated with hypothesis
        is then defined as the expectation of the loss function. In general, the risk cannot be computed
        because the underlying distribution is unknown. However, we can compute an approximation,
        called empirical risk, by averaging the loss function on the training set.</p>

    <p>Empirical risk minimization principle states that the learning algorithm should choose
        a hypothesis which minimizes the empirical risk.</p>

    <p>Batch learning algorithms generate the model by learning on the entire training data set at once.
        In contrast, online learning methods update the model with new data in a sequential order.
        Online learning is a common technique on big data where
        it is computationally infeasible to train over the entire dataset.
        It is also used when the data itself is generated over the time.</p>

    <p>If the response variable is of category values, supervised learning problems are called classification.
        While the response variable is of real values, it is referred as regression.</p>

    <h3 id="overfitting">Overfitting</h3>

    <p>When a model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship, it is called overfitting.
        Overfitting generally occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters
        relative to the number of observations. A overfit model will generally have poor generalization
        performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.</p>

    <div style="width: 100%; display: inline-block; text-align: center;">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Overfitting.svg" width="480px">
        <div class="caption" style="min-width: 480px;">The overfit model in green makes no
            errors on the trainning data. But it is over complex and describes random noise.</div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="model-validation">Model Validation</h3>

    <p>To assess if the model be not overfit and can generalize to an independent data set,
        out-of-sample evaluation is generally employed. If the model has been estimated over some, but not all,
        of the available data, then the model using the estimated parameters can be used to predict the
        held-back data.</p>

    <p>A popular model validation technique is cross-validation. One round of cross-validation involves
        partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset
        (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the testing set).
        To reduce variability, multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions,
        and the validation results are averaged over the rounds.</p>

    <h3 id="regularization">Regularization</h3>

    <p>Regularization refers to a process of introducing additional information in order to prevent overfitting
        (or to solve an ill-posed problem). In general, a regularization term, typically a penalty on the complexity of
        hypothesis, is introduced to a general loss function with a parameter controlling the importance of
        the regularization term. For example, regularization term may be restrictions for smoothness
        or bounds on the vector space norm.</p>

    <p>Regularization can be used to learn simpler models, induce models to be sparse, introduce group structure
        into the learning problem, and more.</p>

    <p>A theoretical justification for regularization is that it attempts to impose Occam's razor on the solution.
        From a Bayesian point of view, many regularization techniques correspond to imposing certain prior
        distributions on model parameters.</p>


    <h2 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised Learning</h2>

    <p>Unsupervised learning tries to infer a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled data.
        Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no error or reward signal
        to evaluate a potential solution.</p>

    <p>Unsupervised learning is closely related to the problem of density estimation in statistics.
        However unsupervised learning also encompasses many other techniques that seek to summarize
        and explain key features of the data.</p>

    <h3 id="clustering">Clustering</h3>
    <p>Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects such that objects
        in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.</p>

    <h3 id="latent-variable-models">Latent Variable Models </h3>
    <p>In statistics, latent variables are variables that are not directly observed but are rather inferred
        from other observed variables. Mathematical models that aim to explain observed variables in terms
        of latent variables are called latent variable models.</p>

    <h3 id="association-rules">Association Rules</h3>
    <p>Association rule mining is to identify strong and interesting relations between variables in large databases.
        Introduced by Rakesh Agrawal et al., a typical use case is to discover regularities between products
        in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale systems in supermarkets. For example,
        the rule \{\mathrm{onions, potatoes}\} \Rightarrow \{\mathrm{burger}\} found in the sales data of
        a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also
        buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities
        (e.g., promotional pricing or product placements).</p>

    <h2 id="semi-supervised-learning">Semi-supervised Learning</h2>

    <p>The acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem is usually labor intensive, time consuming, and
        of high cost. On the other hand, acquisition of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive.
        Researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data,
        can produce considerable improvement in model accuracy.
        Semi-supervised learning is a class of supervised learning tasks and techniques that make use of
        both a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data.</p>

    <h2 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement Learning</h2>

    <p>Reinforcement learning is about a learning agent interacting with its environment
        to achieve a goal. The learning agent has to map situations to actions to maximize
        a numerical reward signal. Different from supervised learning, the learner is not told which actions
        to take but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. Moreover,
        actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also all subsequent rewards.
        Trial-and-error search and delayed reward are the most important features of reinforcement learning.</p>

    <p>Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision making
        in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.</p>
