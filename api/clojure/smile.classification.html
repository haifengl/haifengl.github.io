In principle, AdaBoost is a meta-algorithm, and can be used in conjunction
with many other learning algorithms to improve their performance. In
practice, AdaBoost with decision trees is probably the most popular
combination. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent classifiers
built are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous
classifiers. AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers. However
in some problems it can be less susceptible to the over-fitting problem
than most learning algorithms.

AdaBoost calls a weak classifier repeatedly in a series of rounds from
total T classifiers. For each call a distribution of weights is updated
that indicates the importance of examples in the data set for the
classification. On each round, the weights of each incorrectly classified
example are increased (or alternatively, the weights of each correctly
classified example are decreased), so that the new classifier focuses more
on those examples.

The basic AdaBoost algorithm is only for binary classification problem.
For multi-class classification, a common approach is reducing the
multi-class classification problem to multiple two-class problems.
This implementation is a multi-class AdaBoost without such reductions.

<pre class="plaintext">Decision tree.

A classification/regression tree can be learned by splitting the training
set into subsets based on an attribute value test. This process is repeated
on each derived subset in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning.
The recursion is completed when the subset at a node all has the same value
of the target variable, or when splitting no longer adds value to the
predictions.

The algorithms that are used for constructing decision trees usually
work top-down by choosing a variable at each step that is the next best
variable to use in splitting the set of items. 'Best' is defined by how
well the variable splits the set into homogeneous subsets that have
the same value of the target variable. Different algorithms use different
formulae for measuring 'best'. Used by the CART algorithm, Gini impurity
is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would
be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the
distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by
summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability
of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when
all cases in the node fall into a single target category. Information gain
is another popular measure, used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 algorithms.
Information gain is based on the concept of entropy used in information
theory. For categorical variables with different number of levels, however,
information gain are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.
Instead, one may employ the information gain ratio, which solves the drawback
of information gain.

Classification and Regression Tree techniques have a number of advantages
over many of those alternative techniques.
 - Simple to understand and interpret:
In most cases, the interpretation of results summarized in a tree is
very simple. This simplicity is useful not only for purposes of rapid
classification of new observations, but can also often yield a much simpler
'model' for explaining why observations are classified or predicted in a
particular manner.
 - Able to handle both numerical and categorical data:
Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that
have only one type of variable.
 - Nonparametric and nonlinear:
The final results of using tree methods for classification or regression
can be summarized in a series of (usually few) logical if-then conditions
(tree nodes). Therefore, there is no implicit assumption that the underlying
relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent variable
are linear, follow some specific non-linear link function, or that they
are even monotonic in nature. Thus, tree methods are particularly well
suited for data mining tasks, where there is often little a priori
knowledge nor any coherent set of theories or predictions regarding which
variables are related and how. In those types of data analytics, tree
methods can often reveal simple relationships between just a few variables
that could have easily gone unnoticed using other analytic techniques.

One major problem with classification and regression trees is their high
variance. Often a small change in the data can result in a very different
series of splits, making interpretation somewhat precarious. Besides,
decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that cause over-fitting.
Mechanisms such as pruning are necessary to avoid this problem.
Another limitation of trees is the lack of smoothness of the prediction
surface.

Some techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forest use more than
one decision tree for their analysis.

<pre class="plaintext">Fisher's linear discriminant.

Fisher's linear discriminant. Fisher defined the separation between two
distributions to be the ratio of the variance between the classes to
the variance within the classes, which is, in some sense, a measure
of the signal-to-noise ratio for the class labeling. FLD finds a linear
combination of features which maximizes the separation after the projection.
The resulting combination may be used for dimensionality reduction
before later classification.

The terms Fisher's linear discriminant and LDA are often used
interchangeably, although FLD actually describes a slightly different
discriminant, which does not make some of the assumptions of LDA such
as normally distributed classes or equal class covariances.
When the assumptions of LDA are satisfied, FLD is equivalent to LDA.

FLD is also closely related to principal component analysis (PCA), which also
looks for linear combinations of variables which best explain the data.
As a supervised method, FLD explicitly attempts to model the
difference between the classes of data. On the other hand, PCA is a
unsupervised method and does not take into account any difference in class.

One complication in applying FLD (and LDA) to real data
occurs when the number of variables/features does not exceed
the number of samples. In this case, the covariance estimates do not have
full rank, and so cannot be inverted. This is known as small sample size
problem.

<pre class="plaintext">Gradient boosted classification trees.

Generic gradient boosting at the t-th step would fit a regression tree to
pseudo-residuals. Let J be the number of its leaves. The tree partitions
the input space into J disjoint regions and predicts a constant value in
each region. The parameter J controls the maximum allowed
level of interaction between variables in the model. With J = 2 (decision
stumps), no interaction between variables is allowed. With J = 3 the model
may include effects of the interaction between up to two variables, and
so on. Hastie et al. comment that typically 4 &amp;le; J &amp;le; 8 work well
for boosting and results are fairly insensitive to the choice of in
this range, J = 2 is insufficient for many applications, and J &amp;gt; 10 is
unlikely to be required.

Fitting the training set too closely can lead to degradation of the model's
generalization ability. Several so-called regularization techniques reduce
this over-fitting effect by constraining the fitting procedure.
One natural regularization parameter is the number of gradient boosting
iterations T (i.e. the number of trees in the model when the base learner
is a decision tree). Increasing T reduces the error on training set,
but setting it too high may lead to over-fitting. An optimal value of T
is often selected by monitoring prediction error on a separate validation
data set.

Another regularization approach is the shrinkage which times a parameter
&amp;eta; (called the 'learning rate') to update term.
Empirically it has been found that using small learning rates (such as
&amp;eta; &amp;lt; 0.1) yields dramatic improvements in model's generalization ability
over gradient boosting without shrinking (&amp;eta; = 1). However, it comes at
the price of increasing computational time both during training and
prediction: lower learning rate requires more iterations.

Soon after the introduction of gradient boosting Friedman proposed a
minor modification to the algorithm, motivated by Breiman's bagging method.
Specifically, he proposed that at each iteration of the algorithm, a base
learner should be fit on a subsample of the training set drawn at random
without replacement. Friedman observed a substantial improvement in
gradient boosting's accuracy with this modification.

Subsample size is some constant fraction f of the size of the training set.
When f = 1, the algorithm is deterministic and identical to the one
described above. Smaller values of f introduce randomness into the
algorithm and help prevent over-fitting, acting as a kind of regularization.
The algorithm also becomes faster, because regression trees have to be fit
to smaller datasets at each iteration. Typically, f is set to 0.5, meaning
that one half of the training set is used to build each base learner.

Also, like in bagging, sub-sampling allows one to define an out-of-bag
estimate of the prediction performance improvement by evaluating predictions
on those observations which were not used in the building of the next
base learner. Out-of-bag estimates help avoid the need for an independent
validation dataset, but often underestimate actual performance improvement
and the optimal number of iterations.

Gradient tree boosting implementations often also use regularization by
limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes.
It's used in the tree building process by ignoring any splits that lead
to nodes containing fewer than this number of training set instances.
Imposing this limit helps to reduce variance in predictions at leaves.

<pre class="plaintext">Linear discriminant analysis.

LDA is based on the Bayes decision theory and assumes that the conditional
probability density functions are normally distributed. LDA also makes
the simplifying homoscedastic assumption (i.e. that the class covariances
are identical) and that the covariances have full rank. With these
assumptions, the discriminant function of an input being in a class is
purely a function of this linear combination of independent variables.

LDA is closely related to ANOVA (analysis of variance) and linear regression
analysis, which also attempt to express one dependent variable as a
linear combination of other features or measurements. In the other two
methods, however, the dependent variable is a numerical quantity, while
for LDA it is a categorical variable (i.e. the class label). Logistic
regression and probit regression are more similar to LDA, as they also
explain a categorical variable. These other methods are preferable in
applications where it is not reasonable to assume that the independent
variables are normally distributed, which is a fundamental assumption
of the LDA method.

One complication in applying LDA (and Fisher's discriminant) to real data

<div class="doc">
<pre class="plaintext">Logistic regression.

Logistic regression (logit model) is a generalized linear model used for
binomial regression. Logistic regression applies maximum likelihood
estimation after transforming the dependent into a logit variable.
A logit is the natural log of the odds of the dependent equaling a
certain value or not (usually 1 in binary logistic models, the highest
value in multinomial models). In this way, logistic regression
estimates the odds of a certain event (value) occurring.

Goodness-of-fit tests such as the likelihood ratio test are available
as indicators of model appropriateness, as is the Wald statistic to test
the significance of individual independent variables.

Logistic regression has many analogies to ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression. Unlike OLS regression, however, logistic regression does not
assume linearity of relationship between the raw values of the independent
variables and the dependent, does not require normally distributed variables,
does not assume homoscedasticity, and in general has less stringent
requirements.

Compared with linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression has several
advantages:

 - It is more robust: the independent variables don't have to be normally
   distributed, or have equal variance in each group

 - It does not assume a linear relationship between the independent
   variables and dependent variable.

 - It may handle nonlinear effects since one can add explicit interaction
   and power terms.

However, it requires much more data to achieve stable, meaningful results.

Logistic regression also has strong connections with neural network and
maximum entropy modeling. For example, binary logistic regression is
equivalent to a one-layer, single-output neural network with a logistic
activation function trained under log loss. Similarly, multinomial logistic
regression is equivalent to a one-layer, softmax-output neural network.

Logistic regression estimation also obeys the maximum entropy principle, and
thus logistic regression is sometimes called 'maximum entropy modeling',
and the resulting classifier the 'maximum entropy classifier'.

`y` is the training labels in `[0, k)`, where `k` is the number of classes.

Maximum entropy is a technique for learning probability distributions
from data. In maximum entropy models, the observed data itself is assumed
to be the testable information. Maximum entropy models don't assume
anything about the probability distribution other than what have been
observed and always choose the most uniform distribution subject to
the observed constraints.

Basically, maximum entropy classifier is another name of multinomial logistic
regression applied to categorical independent variables, which are
converted to binary dummy variables. Maximum entropy models are widely
used in natural language processing.  Here, we provide an implementation
which assumes that binary features are stored in a sparse array, of which
entries are the indices of nonzero features.

<div class="doc">
<pre class="plaintext">Multilayer perceptron neural network.

An MLP consists of several layers of nodes, interconnected through weighted
acyclic arcs from each preceding layer to the following, without lateral or
feedback connections. Each node calculates a transformed weighted linear
combination of its inputs (output activations from the preceding layer), with
one of the weights acting as a trainable bias connected to a constant input.
The transformation, called activation function, is a bounded non-decreasing
(non-linear) function, such as the sigmoid functions (ranges from 0 to 1).
Another popular activation function is hyperbolic tangent which is actually
equivalent to the sigmoid function in shape but ranges from -1 to 1.
More specialized activation functions include radial basis functions which
are used in RBF networks.

The representational capabilities of a MLP are determined by the range of
mappings it may implement through weight variation. Single layer perceptrons
are capable of solving only linearly separable problems. With the sigmoid
function as activation function, the single-layer network is identical
to the logistic regression model.

The universal approximation theorem for neural networks states that every
continuous function that maps intervals of real numbers to some output
interval of real numbers can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a
multi-layer perceptron with just one hidden layer. This result holds only
for restricted classes of activation functions, which are extremely complex
and NOT smooth for subtle mathematical reasons. On the other hand, smoothness
is important for gradient descent learning. Besides, the proof is not
constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of
the weights. Therefore, complex systems will have more layers of neurons
with some having increased layers of input neurons and output neurons
in practice.

The most popular algorithm to train MLPs is back-propagation, which is a
gradient descent method. Based on chain rule, the algorithm propagates the
error back through the network and adjusts the weights of each connection in
order to reduce the value of the error function by some small amount.
For this reason, back-propagation can only be applied on networks with
differentiable activation functions.

During error back propagation, we usually times the gradient with a small
number &amp;eta;, called learning rate, which is carefully selected to ensure
that the network converges to a local minimum of the error function
fast enough, without producing oscillations. One way to avoid oscillation
at large &amp;eta;, is to make the change in weight dependent on the past weight
change by adding a momentum term.

Although the back-propagation algorithm may performs gradient
descent on the total error of all instances in a batch way,
the learning rule is often applied to each instance separately in an online
way or stochastic way. There exists empirical indication that the stochastic
way results in faster convergence.

In practice, the problem of over-fitting has emerged. This arises in
convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network
significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. There are two general
approaches for avoiding this problem: The first is to use cross-validation
and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-fitting and
optimally select hyper-parameters such as to minimize the generalization
error. The second is to use some form of regularization, which emerges
naturally in a Bayesian framework, where the regularization can be
performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models;
but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over
the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk'.

For neural networks, the input patterns usually should be
scaled/standardized. Commonly, each input variable is scaled into
interval `[0, 1]` or to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

For penalty functions and output units, the following natural pairings are
recommended:

 - linear output units and a least squares penalty function.
 - a two-class cross-entropy penalty function and a logistic
   activation function.
 - a multi-class cross-entropy penalty function and a softmax
   activation function.

By assigning a softmax activation function on the output layer of
the neural network for categorical target variables, the outputs
can be interpreted as posterior probabilities, which are very useful.

QDA is closely related to linear discriminant
analysis (LDA). Like LDA, QDA models the conditional probability density
functions as a Gaussian distribution, then uses the posterior distributions
to estimate the class for a given test data. Unlike LDA, however,
in QDA there is no assumption that the covariance of each of the classes
is identical. Therefore, the resulting separating surface between
the classes is quadratic.

The Gaussian parameters for each class can be estimated from training data
with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. However, when the number of
training instances is small compared to the dimension of input space,
the ML covariance estimation can be ill-posed. One approach to resolve
the ill-posed estimation is to regularize the covariance estimation.
One of these regularization methods is the regularized discriminant
analysis.

<pre class="plaintext">Random forest.

Random forest is an ensemble classifier that consists of many decision
trees and outputs the majority vote of individual trees. The method
combines bagging idea and the random selection of features.

Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:

 1. If the number of cases in the training set is N, randomly sample N cases
with replacement from the original data. This sample will
be the training set for growing the tree.
 2. If there are M input variables, a number m &amp;lt;&amp;lt; M is specified such
that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M and
the best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of m is
held constant during the forest growing.
 3. Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. There is no pruning.

The advantages of random forest are:

 - For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier.
 - It runs efficiently on large data sets.
 - It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.
 - It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.
 - It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error
as the forest building progresses.
 - It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains
accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.

The disadvantages are

 - Random forests are prone to over-fitting for some datasets. This is
even more pronounced on noisy data.
 - For data including categorical variables with different number of
levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more
levels. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are

<pre class="plaintext">Radial basis function networks.

A radial basis function network is an artificial neural network that uses
radial basis functions as activation functions. It is a linear combination
of radial basis functions. They are used in function approximation, time
series prediction, and control.

In its basic form, radial basis function network is in the form
```
y(x) = &amp;Sigma; w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;phi;(||x-c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;||)
```
where the approximating function y(x) is represented as a sum of N radial
basis functions &amp;phi;, each associated with a different center c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,
and weighted by an appropriate coefficient w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. For distance,
one usually chooses Euclidean distance. The weights w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; can
be estimated using the matrix methods of linear least squares, because
the approximating function is linear in the weights.

The centers c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; can be randomly selected from training data,
or learned by some clustering method (e.g. k-means), or learned together
with weight parameters undergo a supervised learning processing
(e.g. error-correction learning).

The popular choices for &amp;phi; comprise the Gaussian function and the so
called thin plate splines. The advantage of the thin plate splines is that
their conditioning is invariant under scalings. Gaussian, multi-quadric
and inverse multi-quadric are infinitely smooth and and involve a scale
or shape parameter, r&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;0&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0. Decreasing
r&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;0&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; tends to flatten the basis function. For a
given function, the quality of approximation may strongly depend on this
parameter. In particular, increasing r&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;0&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; has the
effect of better conditioning (the separation distance of the scaled points
increases).

A variant on RBF networks is normalized radial basis function (NRBF)
networks, in which we require the sum of the basis functions to be unity.
NRBF arises more naturally from a Bayesian statistical perspective. However,
there is no evidence that either the NRBF method is consistently superior
to the RBF method, or vice versa.

SVMs with Gaussian kernel have similar structure as RBF networks with
Gaussian radial basis functions. However, the SVM approach 'automatically'
solves the network complexity problem since the size of the hidden layer
is obtained as the result of the QP procedure. Hidden neurons and
support vectors correspond to each other, so the center problems of
the RBF network is also solved, as the support vectors serve as the
basis function centers. It was reported that with similar number of support
vectors/centers, SVM shows better generalization performance than RBF
network when the training data size is relatively small. On the other hand,
RBF network gives better generalization performance than SVM on large
training data.

`x` is the training samples.
`y` is the training labels in `[0, k)`, where `k` is the number of classes.

<pre class="plaintext">Regularized discriminant analysis.

RDA is a compromise between LDA and QDA, which allows one to shrink
the separate covariances of QDA toward a common variance as in LDA.
This method is very similar in flavor to ridge regression.
The regularized covariance matrices of each class is
```
&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;) = &amp;alpha; &amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; + (1 - &amp;alpha;) &amp;Sigma;
```
The quadratic discriminant function is defined using the shrunken covariance
matrices &amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;). The parameter &amp;alpha; in `[0, 1]`
controls the complexity of the model. When &amp;alpha; is one, RDA becomes QDA.
While &amp;alpha; is zero, RDA is equivalent to LDA. Therefore, the
regularization factor &amp;alpha; allows a continuum of models between LDA
and QDA.

`x` is the training samples.
`y` is the training labels in `[0, k)`, where `k` is the number of classes.
`alpha` is the regularization factor in `[0, 1]` allows a continuum of
models between LDA and QDA.
`priori` is the priori probability of each class.
`tol` is the tolerance to decide if a covariance matrix is singular; it
will reject variables whose variance is less than tol&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.</pre></div>

<pre class="plaintext">Support vector machine.

The basic support vector machine is a binary linear classifier which
chooses the hyperplane that represents the largest separation, or margin,
between the two classes. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the
maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known
as a maximum margin classifier.

If there exists no hyperplane that can perfectly split the positive and
negative instances, the soft margin method will choose a hyperplane
that splits the instances as cleanly as possible, while still maximizing
the distance to the nearest cleanly split instances.

The nonlinear SVMs are created by applying the kernel trick to
maximum-margin hyperplanes. The resulting algorithm is formally similar,
except that every dot product is replaced by a nonlinear kernel function.
This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a
transformed feature space. The transformation may be nonlinear and
the transformed space be high dimensional. For example, the feature space
corresponding Gaussian kernel is a Hilbert space of infinite dimension.
Thus though the classifier is a hyperplane in the high-dimensional feature
space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space. Maximum margin
classifiers are well regularized, so the infinite dimension does not spoil
the results.

The effectiveness of SVM depends on the selection of kernel, the kernel's
parameters, and soft margin parameter C. Given a kernel, best combination
of C and kernel's parameters is often selected by a grid-search with
cross validation.

The dominant approach for creating multi-class SVMs is to reduce the
single multi-class problem into multiple binary classification problems.
Common methods for such reduction is to build binary classifiers which
distinguish between (i) one of the labels to the rest (one-versus-all)
or (ii) between every pair of classes (one-versus-one). Classification
of new instances for one-versus-all case is done by a winner-takes-all
strategy, in which the classifier with the highest output function assigns
the class. For the one-versus-one approach, classification
is done by a max-wins voting strategy, in which every classifier assigns
the instance to one of the two classes, then the vote for the assigned
class is increased by one vote, and finally the class with most votes
determines the instance classification.

`y is the training labels of +1 or -1.
`kernel` is the Mercer kernel.
`C` is the regularization parameter.
