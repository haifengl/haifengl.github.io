<p>Decision tree. A classification/regression tree can be learned by
splitting the training set into subsets based on an attribute value
test. This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive
manner called recursive partitioning. The recursion is completed when
the subset at a node all has the same value of the target variable,
or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions.</p>
<p>The algorithms that are used for constructing decision trees usually
work top-down by choosing a variable at each step that is the next best
variable to use in splitting the set of items. "Best" is defined by how
well the variable splits the set into homogeneous subsets that have
the same value of the target variable. Different algorithms use different
formulae for measuring "best". Used by the CART algorithm, Gini impurity
is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would
be incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the
distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by
summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability
of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when
all cases in the node fall into a single target category. Information gain
is another popular measure, used by the ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 algorithms.
Information gain is based on the concept of entropy used in information
theory. For categorical variables with different number of levels, however,
information gain are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.
Instead, one may employ the information gain ratio, which solves the drawback
of information gain.</p>
<p>Classification and Regression Tree techniques have a number of advantages
over many of those alternative techniques.</p>
<ul><li>'''Simple to understand and interpret:'''
In most cases, the interpretation of results summarized in a tree is
very simple. This simplicity is useful not only for purposes of rapid
classification of new observations, but can also often yield a much simpler
"model" for explaining why observations are classified or predicted in a
particular manner.</li>
<li>'''Able to handle both numerical and categorical data:'''
Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that
have only one type of variable.</li>
<li>'''Nonparametric and nonlinear:'''
The final results of using tree methods for classification or regression
can be summarized in a series of (usually few) logical if-then conditions
(tree nodes). Therefore, there is no implicit assumption that the underlying
relationships between the predictor variables and the dependent variable
are linear, follow some specific non-linear link function, or that they
are even monotonic in nature. Thus, tree methods are particularly well
suited for data mining tasks, where there is often little a priori
knowledge nor any coherent set of theories or predictions regarding which
variables are related and how. In those types of data analytics, tree
methods can often reveal simple relationships between just a few variables
that could have easily gone unnoticed using other analytic techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>One major problem with classification and regression trees is their high
variance. Often a small change in the data can result in a very different
series of splits, making interpretation somewhat precarious. Besides,
decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that cause over-fitting.
Mechanisms such as pruning are necessary to avoid this problem.
Another limitation of trees is the lack of smoothness of the prediction
surface.</p>
<p>Some techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forest use more than
one decision tree for their analysis.</p>
