<p>Splits English text into sentences. Given an English text,
it returns a list of strings, where each element is an
English sentence. By default, it treats occurrences of '.', '?' and '!' as
sentence delimiters, but does its best to determine when an occurrence of '.'
does not have this role (e.g. in abbreviations, URLs, numbers, etc.).</p>
<p>Recognizing the end of a sentence is not an easy task for a computer.
In English, punctuation marks that usually appear at the end of a sentence
may not indicate the end of a sentence. The period is the worst offender.
A period can end a sentence but it can also be part of an abbreviation
or acronym, an ellipsis, a decimal number, or part of a bracket of periods
surrounding a Roman numeral. A period can even act both as the end of an
abbreviation and the end of a sentence at the same time. Other the other
hand, some poems may not contain any sentence punctuation at all.</p>
<p>Another problem punctuation mark is the single quote, which can introduce
a quote or start a contraction such as 'tis. Leading-quote contractions
are uncommon in contemporary English texts, but appear frequently in Early
Modern English texts.</p>
<p>This tokenizer assumes that the text has already been segmented into
paragraphs. Any carriage returns will be replaced by whitespace.</p>
