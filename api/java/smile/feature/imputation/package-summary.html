<div class="block">Missing value imputation. In statistics, missing data, or missing values,
 occur when no data value is stored for the variable in the current
 observation. Missing data are a common occurrence and can have a
 significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.
 <p>
 Data are missing for many reasons. Missing data can occur because of
 non-response: no information is provided for several items or no information
 is provided for a whole unit. Some items are more sensitive for non-response
 than others, for example items about private subjects such as income.
 <p>
 Dropout is a type of missingness that occurs mostly when studying
 development over time. In this type of study the measurement is repeated
 after a certain period of time. Missingness occurs when participants drop
 out before the test ends and one or more measurements are missing.
 <p>
 Sometimes missing values are caused by the device failure or even by
 researchers themselves. It is important to question why the data is missing,
 this can help with finding a solution to the problem. If the values are
 missing at random there is still information about each variable in each
 unit but if the values are missing systematically the problem is more severe
 because the sample cannot be representative of the population.
 <p>
 All the causes for missing data fit into four classes, which are based
 on the relationship between the missing data mechanism and the missing and
 observed values. These classes are important to understand because the
 problems caused by missing data and the solutions to these problems are
 different for the four classes.
 <p>
 The first is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). MCAR means that the
 missing data mechanism is unrelated to the values of any variables, whether
 missing or observed. Data that are missing because a researcher dropped the
 test tubes or survey participants accidentally skipped questions are
 likely to be MCAR. If the observed values are essentially a random sample
 of the full data set, complete case analysis gives the same results as
 the full data set would have. Unfortunately, most missing data are not MCAR.
 <p>
 At the opposite end of the spectrum is Non-Ignorable (NI). NI means that
 the missing data mechanism is related to the missing values. It commonly
 occurs when people do not want to reveal something very personal or
 unpopular about themselves. For example, if individuals with higher incomes
 are less likely to reveal them on a survey than are individuals with lower
 incomes, the missing data mechanism for income is non-ignorable. Whether
 income is missing or observed is related to its value. Complete case
 analysis can give highly biased results for NI missing data. If
 proportionally more low and moderate income individuals are left in
 the sample because high income people are missing, an estimate of the
 mean income will be lower than the actual population mean.
 <p>
 In between these two extremes are Missing at Random (MAR) and Covariate
 Dependent (CD). Both of these classes require that the cause of the missing
 data is unrelated to the missing values, but may be related to the observed
 values of other variables. MAR means that the missing values are related to
 either observed covariates or response variables, whereas CD means that the
 missing values are related only to covariates. As an example of CD missing
 data, missing income data may be unrelated to the actual income values, but
 are related to education. Perhaps people with more education are less likely
 to reveal their income than those with less education.
 <p>
 A key distinction is whether the mechanism is ignorable (i.e., MCAR, CD, or
 MAR) or non-ignorable. There are excellent techniques for handling ignorable
 missing data. Non-ignorable missing data are more challenging and require a
 different approach.
 <p>
 If it is known that the data analysis technique which is to be used isn't
 content robust, it is good to consider imputing the missing data.
 Once all missing values have been imputed, the dataset can then be analyzed
 using standard techniques for complete data. The analysis should ideally
 take into account that there is a greater degree of uncertainty than if
 the imputed values had actually been observed, however, and this generally
 requires some modification of the standard complete-data analysis methods.
 Many imputation techniques are available.
 <p>
 Imputation is not the only method available for handling missing data.
 The expectation-maximization algorithm is a method for finding maximum
 likelihood estimates that has been widely applied to missing data problems.
 In machine learning, it is sometimes possible to train a classifier directly
 over the original data without imputing it first. That was shown to yield
 better performance in cases where the missing data is structurally absent,
 rather than missing due to measurement noise.</div>
