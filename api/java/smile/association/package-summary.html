<div class="block">Frequent item set mining and association rule mining.
 Association rule learning is a popular and well researched method for
 discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.
 Let I = {i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>,..., i<sub>n</sub>} be a set of n
 binary attributes called items. Let D = {t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>,..., t<sub>m</sub>}
 be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a
 unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I.
 An association rule is defined as an implication of the form X &rArr; Y
 where X, Y &sube; I and X &cap; Y = &Oslash;. The item sets X and Y are called
 antecedent (left-hand-side or LHS) and consequent (right-hand-side or RHS)
 of the rule, respectively. The support supp(X) of an item set X is defined as
 the proportion of transactions in the database which contain the item set.
 Note that the support of an association rule X &rArr; Y is supp(X &cup; Y).
 The confidence of a rule is defined conf(X &rArr; Y) = supp(X &cup; Y) / supp(X).
 Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability P(Y | X),
 the probability of finding the RHS of the rule in transactions under the
 condition that these transactions also contain the LHS.
 <p>
 For example, the rule {onions, potatoes} &rArr; {burger} found in the sales
 data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and
 potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy burger. Such information
 can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as
 promotional pricing or product placements.
 <p>
 Association rules are usually required to satisfy a user-specified minimum
 support and a user-specified minimum confidence at the same time. Association
 rule generation is usually split up into two separate steps:
 <ul>
 <li> First, minimum support is applied to find all frequent item sets
 in a database (i.e. frequent item set mining).
 <li> Second, these frequent item sets and the minimum confidence constraint
 are used to form rules.
 </ul>
 <p>
 Finding all frequent item sets in a database is difficult since it involves
 searching all possible item sets (item combinations). The set of possible
 item sets is the power set over I (the set of items) and has size 2<sup>n</sup> - 1
 (excluding the empty set which is not a valid item set). Although the size
 of the power set grows exponentially in the number of items n in I, efficient
 search is possible using the downward-closure property of support
 (also called anti-monotonicity) which guarantees that for a frequent item set
 also all its subsets are frequent and thus for an infrequent item set, all
 its supersets must be infrequent.
 <p>
 In practice, we may only consider the frequent item set that has the maximum
 number of items bypassing all the sub item sets. An item set is maximal
 frequent if none of its immediate supersets is frequent.
 <p>
 For a maximal frequent item set, even though we know that all the sub item
 sets are frequent, we don't know the actual support of those sub item sets,
 which are very important to find the association rules within the item sets.
 If the final goal is association rule mining, we would like to discover
 closed frequent item sets. An item set is closed if none of its immediate
 supersets has the same support as the item set.
 <p>
 Some well known algorithms of frequent item set mining are Apriori,
 Eclat and FP-Growth. Apriori is the best-known algorithm to mine association
 rules. It uses a breadth-first search strategy to counting the support of
 item sets and uses a candidate generation function which exploits the downward
 closure property of support. Eclat is a depth-first search algorithm using
 set intersection.
 <p>
 FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) uses an extended prefix-tree (FP-tree)
 structure to store the database in a compressed form. FP-growth adopts a
 divide-and-conquer approach to decompose both the mining tasks and the
 databases. It uses a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly
 process of candidate generation and testing used by Apriori.
